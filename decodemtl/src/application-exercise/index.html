    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
      If you are reading this document, it's because you have applied to one of our
      <a href="/web-development-full-time">full-time web development bootcamps</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of your application, you'll have to complete the following exercise. The first part is an online JavaScript
      class that will take you through the basics of programming with JavaScript. In a second part, you will have to write
      a few functions to show your understanding of your newly acquired knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Complete CodeCademy's JavaScript track</a>. This will
      give you a solid base in JavaScript programming as it relates to creating and manipulating data structures, as
      well as creating your own functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything we do with JavaScript, no matter how complex, will end up boiling down to these fundamentals. Even as
      we start using jQuery or NodeJS to do more advanced things, we will always be in a situation where we need to
      manipulate data, and create modularized, re-usable code.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing this track, you should be ready to move on to the exercises below!

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have the fundamentals of JavaScript nailed down, it's time to show off your newly acquired knowledge!
      To do this, you are being asked to create a series of JavaScript functions that respond to certain problems. To
      submit your exercises, you will be <a href="https://tonicdev.com/">creating a notebook on Tonicdev</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sign up for a Tonicdev account, and create a new notebook. For each exercise, insert a new text cell with the full
      text of the exercise, followed by a code cell with your solution. After writing your function, show that it works
      by calling it with the required parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your final, submitted notebook should look like
      <a href="https://tonicdev.com/ziad-saab/decodemtl-application">this example notebook</a>.

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <h4>Exercise 1</h4>
    <p>
      Write a function called <code>firstLetter</code> that takes one string argument and returns the first letter of
      the string.
    </p>
    <h4>Exercise 2</h4>
    <p>
      Write a function called <code>lastLetter</code> that takes one string argument and returns the last letter of
      the string.
    </p>
    <h4>Exercise 3</h4>
    <p>
      Write a function called <code>crazySum</code> that takes an array of numbers, and returns the sum of each number
      multiplied by its position in the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you pass <code>[4, 8, 15, 16]</code>, the program will calculate 4*1 + 8*2 + 15*3 + 16*4 and give
      you that back as an answer.
    </p>
    <h4>Exercise 4</h4>
    <p>
      Write a function called <code>fizzBuzz</code> that doesn't take any arguments and doesn't return anything. This
      function should print all the numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is dividable by 3, then it should print FIZZ
      instead of the number. If the number is dividable by 5, then it should print BUZZ instead of the number. If the
      number is dividable by 3 AND 5, then it should print FIZZBUZZ instead of the number.
    </p>
    <h4>Exercise 5</h4>
    <p>
      Write a function called <code>factorial</code> that takes a number as argument and returns the
      <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/factorial.html">factorial</a> of that number.
    </p>

    <h3>You are done :)</h3>
    You are done! Please use the "publish" functionality at the top of your Tonicdev notebook to publish it with a fixed
    URL. Then submit this URL to us at <a href="mailto:hello@decodemtl.com">hello@decodemtl.com</a>. We will get back to
    you shortly after :)
